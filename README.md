## Story

I came up with this idea when I realized:
> The globally **failing *economic*, *political* and *social institutions*** induce bottom-up collaborations, because fixing our problems from above **does not provide lasting solutions** to our needs anymore.

We need secure tools and effective methods for **efficient allocation of resources**, because today independent communities lack technology to *collect*, *process*, and *share* their available resources, as well as the resources in need.

We started to develop an open-source **resource mapping solution** done in an *independent* and *collaborative* way, with *anonymous data collection* and *secure information management*, which are key roles today! We are developing a **highly customizable open-source toolkit** for this.

In a *collaborative society* all *independent communities* need to have any resources to **do their best** and be able to communicate **without boundaries** in a secure way.
Example: Local farmers can map and share their available machinery and ask for unused organic materials, then others farmers doesn't need to buy and maintain those expensive tools and can give back materials to increase fertility. In the same time a small gardener will know where to go for a good compost and where to send her kids to learn about growing food.
