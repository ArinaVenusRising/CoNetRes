# :sunflower: ***CoNetRes*** the independent *Community Network Resource Mapping* toolkit
*Community Network Resource Mapping* software provides a big picture of the **supply**, **support**, and **aid** **capacity** and **needs** of a community, to support effective and efficient collaboration.

## :star: Features

- Using *CoNetRes* any community member can start multiple virtual communities and define tags as references to be able to connect globally through matching.
- Using *CoNetRes* anyone can share and request any kind of resources anonymously within their communities and/or make publicly available in the name of the community.

## :fire: Story

I came up with this idea when I realized:
> The globally **failing *economic*, *political* and *social institutions*** induce bottom-up collaborations, because fixing our problems from above **does not provide lasting solutions** to our needs anymore.

We need secure tools and effective methods for **efficient allocation of resources**, because today independent communities lack technology to *collect*, *process*, and *share* their available resources, as well as the resources in need.

We started to develop an open-source **resource mapping solution** done in an *independent* and *collaborative* way, with *anonymous data collection* and *secure information management*, which are key roles today! We are developing a **highly customizable open-source toolkit** for this.

In a *collaborative society* all *independent communities* need to have any resources to **do their best** and be able to communicate **without boundaries** in a secure way.
Example: Local farmers can map and share their available machinery and ask for unused organic materials, then others farmers doesn't need to buy and maintain those expensive tools and can give back materials to increase fertility. In the same time a small gardener will know where to go for a good compost and where to send her kids to learn about growing food.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Development
*CoResNet* is an **open-source toolkit** for *independent communities* to be able **to articulate the needs and share available resources** in a secure and trustworthy way.

> We are open for any kind of support to have this software available to any community around the world!

[JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Golang coders, holochain specialists, data scientists and Machine Learning experts are needed to team up! | Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/i2we20-community-network-resource-mapping-toolkit-dev/joins/pXX5uQfIV87UWdQpEjHzXA)

1. We are using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) to clarify the bigger picture and to collaborate on all related information.
2. Using social interactions and google forms we undertook research across different communities.
3. The technical background for the development is provided by other open-source solutions, like [ßoiler](https://github.com/LaKing/boilerplate "is a modular framework for Javascript-based projects, mainly web applications") Javascript framework with [codepad](https://github.com/LaKing/codepad "Browser-based collaborative development environment"), the collaborative development environment running on [srvctl](https://github.com/LaKing/srvctl "Systemd based server and containerfarm manager").
4. The main language is `JavaScript` with `node.js` and `Vue.js`, using `JSON`, `HTML5`, `CSS`.
5. Source code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/eapo/CoNetRes/)
